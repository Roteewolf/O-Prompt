# O-Prompt 4.0 Language Specification

## 1. Introduction

### What is O-Prompt?
O-Prompt is a lightweight, LLM-focused prompt engineering language developed by Rotee. It is designed to optimize the clarity, efficiency, and expressiveness of prompts in a way that surpasses traditional systems like Markdown or JSON-based formats. Its purpose is to enable precise instruction of AI behavior through compact, modular, and semantically rich syntax.

### Purpose & Philosophy
The core philosophy behind O-Prompt is to simplify prompt construction while increasing its interpretability for AI modelsâ€”especially for small and mid-size LLMs. Unlike most languages that avoid negatives, O-Prompt embraces `DO NOT` directives to increase clarity and control. Inspired by practices in image models like Stable Diffusion, O-Prompt allows for weighted attention, conditional logic, and explicit sampling guidanceâ€”all in human-readable form.

### Version History
- **v1.0** (2025-01-14): Initial prototype, used in "Rotee's RP Prompt Mild 1.2 Preview"
- **v4.0** (2025-04): Fully modular structure, model-tested with LLaMA3 7B, Claude Haiku, and GPT-3.5 class models
